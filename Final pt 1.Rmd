```{r}
#Test where the NAs are
which(is.na(loans50k), arr.ind=TRUE)

#Found a bunch in "employment". Inspect further and possibly eliminate/transform. 
```
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
#Make new variable: Set "Good" and "Bad" Loans, all else "blank" to be removed later
df <-
  loans50k %>%
  mutate(payment_status = case_when(
    status == "Fully Paid" ~ "Good", 
    status == "Charged Off" ~ "Bad",
    TRUE ~ ""
  ))

#change the empty string cells to NAs
df[df==""]<-NA

#To change NA in "employment"" column, set as either Yes or "unknown"
df <-
  df %>%
  mutate(Employed = ifelse(!is.na(employment), "Yes", "Unknown"))
#Remove Original employment Column
df$employment<- NULL


```

```{r}
#Test where the NAs are again:
which(is.na(df), arr.ind=TRUE)

#Row 34806 is missing all values, eliminate and test again:
test <- df[-c(34806),] 
```
